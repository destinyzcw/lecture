## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

let n_row be the number of rows,
    n_max be the maximum number of students in all rows
    t_one be the time it takes to count one person
    t_start be the time to start the process
    t_compute be the time it takes to compute row counts
    t_gather be the time to gather counts
    t_ari be the time to do arithmetic
    then
        t_total = t_start + t_compute + t_gather + t_ari + t_one * n_max;
        
2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

let n_total be the number of students in total
    then
        t = n_total * t_one;
3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
     if t_total < t
     then
         n_total > (t_start + t_compute + t_gather + t_ari + t_one * n_max) / t_one;
